          <div>
            <p>
              I am a self-taught programmer and prefer to learn new things,
              challenge myself, and do interesting things that matter.
            </p>
            <p>
              My energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies,
              areas of study and coding skills. Iâ€™m a fast learner, able to pick
              up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with
              relative ease.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and a team player ready
              to help my team members.
            </p>
